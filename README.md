# WebVoteView

This is the source repository for WebVoteView, hosted at [voteview.polisci.ucla.edu].

Our site backend is MongoDB+Python (Bottle), and our frontend uses JQuery, D3, DC.js, Bootstrap, and other dependencies. For more information on our stack, please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/JeffreyBLewis/WebVoteView/wiki). We develop in the dev branch and deploy stable deployments to master.

We welcome external contributions; please open an issue if you find a bug or would like to contribute code, and direct all pull requests towards dev rather than master.

For more information or to contact us directly check the [About](http://voteview.polisci.ucla.edu/about) page of our site.
