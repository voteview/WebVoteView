# WebVoteView

This is the source repository for WebVoteView, hosted at https://voteview.com and operated by UCLA Political Science. The site allows users to visualize congressional roll-call votes throughout history as well as classify legislators ideologically using the NOMINATE process. We are also a data clearinghouse for legislator ideology scores. 

Our site backend is NGINX, uWSGI, Python (Bottle), and MongoDB, and our frontend uses JQuery, D3, DC.js, Bootstrap, and other dependencies. For more information on our stack, please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/JeffreyBLewis/WebVoteView/wiki). We develop in the dev branch and deploy stable deployments to master.

We welcome external contributions; please open an issue if you find a bug or would like to contribute code, and direct all pull requests towards dev rather than master.

For more information or to contact us directly check the [About](https://voteview.com/about) page of our site.
